Weather application with core Location and API requests

In this app I´m getting the weather data and forecast for the current GPS location of the mobile device.

After getting the location I´m calling the open weather API to retrieve the current weather and weather forecast.

https://openweathermap.org/api

It is a free API service for a fixed number of calls, you can test by creating a free account and putting your api keys.
